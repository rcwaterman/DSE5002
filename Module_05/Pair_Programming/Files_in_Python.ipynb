The basic file operations (read, write) in Python (and R, Matlab and many other languages) all seem to work the same way.  I don't know if this method was the same in earlier languages or not,    C may have lifted it from somewhere else.   I do know R and Python use subroutines in C,  so I suppose the use of C styel file I/O should not come as a surprise.  In any case, you now know how this family of methods works,   just look up the fine details in R or Python as needed.\n",
